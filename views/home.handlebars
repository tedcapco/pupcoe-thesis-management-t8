          <h2>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCOE)</h2>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <hr class="botm-line">
          <p class="desc">In 1978, the Philippine College of Commerce was transformed into PolytechnicUniversity of the Philippines by virtue of Presidential Decree 1341. This led to the abolition of the Center for Skills and Rural Industries Development (CSRID) and the creation of the Faculty of Technology with Professor Banaag A. Villaflor as Officer-in-charge. The three ladderized engineering programs that were initially offered for school year 1979-1980 were the Bachelor in Computer Technology (BCET), Bachelor on Electrical Engineering (BEE) and Bachelor in Electronics Engineering (BEL).</p>
          <p class="desc">The Bachelor in Computer Technology was initially offered as a three-year diploma course and was later approved as a five (5) year course known as the Bachelor in Computer Engineering. The department started with one section and with 55 students enrolled in the first year during the first semester of the school year 1979-1980. The first batch produces thirteen (13) graduates that successfully earned the degree of Bachelor in Computer Engineering on April 6, 1984.</p>
          <p class="desc">In 1980, the Faculty of Technology was changed to the level of Institute of Technology under the leadership of Dr. Romulo M. Ricafranca as Director. With the impressive academic performance and increasing number of enrollees, the Institute was converted into a College of Engineering in 1984 with Engr. German A. Padua as Director.</p>
          <p class="desc">Under the presidency of Dr. Nemesio E. Prudente in 1986, the BCET curriculum was revised into Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCoE). This is to align with the standards and requirement s set by the Ministry of Education Culture and Sports (MECS) and the Technical Panel for Engineering Education (TPEE). The department grew and increases in to three (3) sections and at present with five (5) sections per year level.</p>
          <p class="desc">With the college objectives to become globally competitive and to have state-of-the-art technology, a Memorandum of Agreement was singed on December 5, 1989 by Dr. Nemesio E. Prudente, representing PUP, and Dr. Masamuzi Kumagai, representing the government of Japan, in the presences of Japan Cooperating Agency (JICA) officials.</p>
          <p class="desc">It was under the leadership of Engr. Alberto C. Ca√±ete when JICA turned-over several state-of-the-art laboratory equipment and facilities to the College on November 1991. Six (6) Personal Computer Laboratory Rooms were created to house the ninety sis (96) microcomputers, one (1) Computer Laboratory, one (1) Microcomputer Control Laboratory and one (1) Microprocessor Laboratory specifically designed to fully utilized The (JICA) equipment such as Z-80 microprocessor trainers and robot arm. Japanese expert and engineers were sent to PUP to provide instruction and assistance. Moreover, faculty members were sent to Japan for training and how to use and maintain this equipment. Engr. Remedios G. Ado and Engr. Ronald D. Fernando attended the JICA training program on "Fabrication and Application of Interface Circuit for the Microprocessor" in Sendai College on October to December 1993 and 1994 respectively.</p>
          <p class="desc">Engr. Eleanor M. Pineda, as the first Laboratory Head of the department was appointed on August 1, 1993. Engr. Ronald D. Fernando took over the place of Engr. Pineda on March 21 1994. The need for maintenance team was taken into consideration by the administration and appointed Engr. Fernando as head in the University Information Technology Laboratory Maintenance.</p>
          <p class="desc">In November 1997, the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with the other engineering program attained the Level I status by the AACCUP. Engr. Estelita B. Del Rosario, accreditation coordinator, retired the following year after more than 30 years in government service.</p>
          <p class="desc">Change of leadership took place in the college when the term of Dean Dante V. Gedaria expired last November 3, 1998. Engr. Vicky S. Cruz assumed the Deanship position while Engr. Ben B. Andres became the Accreditation Coordinator.</p>
          <p class="desc">In June 2000, the separation of the Department of Architecture from the College of Engineering and Architecture took place, and the addition of the Department of Fine Arts gave birth to the College of Architecture and Fine Arts.</p>
